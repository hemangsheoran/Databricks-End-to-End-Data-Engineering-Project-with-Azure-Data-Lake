# Repository Overview
This repository contains a full end-to-end data engineering pipeline built using Azure Databricks, PySpark, streaming ingestion methods, Delta Lake, and the star schema modelling approach. The goal is to simulate a real-world engineering project â€” from raw data ingestion through transformations, streaming, slowly changing dimensions, and final analytical schema.
